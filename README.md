Secure Data Network System (SDNS)

The Secure Data Network System (SDNS) architecture and a set of associated specifications were developed through a multi- organizational project sponsored by the National Security Agency (NSA) in 1987. They are presented here for historical reference.

The SDNS project was initiated by NSA to investigate methods of implementing security in a distributed computer network. The results of this project include a set of specifications that include security services, protocols and mechanisms for protecting user data in networks that are based on the OSI computer network model. These NSA specifications were released openly and became the basis for INternet network and messaging security tehnologies.
